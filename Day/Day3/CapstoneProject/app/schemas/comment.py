# app/schemas/comment.py
#
# Purpose:
#   Defines the Pydantic models for the Comment entity.
#   A comment always belongs to exactly one ticket (the ticket_id comes from
#   the URL path, not the request body — see app/routers/comments.py).
#
# Concepts demonstrated here (same pattern as previous entities):
#   - Request models   -> CommentCreate, CommentUpdate
#   - Field validation -> min_length/max_length rules
#   - Response models  -> CommentResponse defines the API's output shape
