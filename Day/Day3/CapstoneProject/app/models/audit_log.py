# app/models/audit_log.py
#
# Purpose:
#   Describes the shape of an "audit_log" document as stored in MongoDB.
#   Audit logs are NEVER created directly by a client through a POST
#   endpoint — they are automatically written by the Ticket router
#   whenever a ticket is created, assigned, or changes status
#   (see app/routers/tickets.py).
#
# An audit_log document in MongoDB looks like this:
#   {
#       "id": "「uuid4 string」",
#       "ticket_id": "「ticket's uuid4 string」",
#       "action": "status_changed",
#       "performed_by": "「user's uuid4 string」",
#       "details": "Status changed from 'new' to 'assigned'",
#       "created_at": "2026-09-22T10:00:00"
#   }
